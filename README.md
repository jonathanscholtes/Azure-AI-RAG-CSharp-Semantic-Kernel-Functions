# GenAI RAG Chat Solution with .NET, Semantic Kernel, Python, and Prompty  

## Overview  

This repository provides a guide to operationalizing a Generative AI (GenAI) solution on Azure using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. The solution includes a RAG Chat API that leverages customer data, along with technical HTML files, to assist customer support teams in troubleshooting customer issues efficiently. It utilizes Azure services such as Azure AI Search for vector storage and Azure OpenAI for model inference, all supported by a .NET-based API backend.

Designed with a focus on security, scalability, and optimal user experience, this solution follows best practices for deploying RAG workflows on Azure. It ensures seamless integration of data retrieval and generative capabilities, providing robust, context-aware responses to customer queries while maintaining high standards for data privacy and system performance.

## Key Features  

- **RAG Architecture**: Implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation workflow, combining generative AI with vectorized retrieval for contextually enriched responses.  
- **Azure AI Search Vector Store**: Leverages Azure AI Search for efficient embedding storage, enabling fast retrieval of relevant data to enhance responses.  
- **Azure Cosmos DB Document Store**: Utilizes Azure Cosmos DB to store documents and provide additional context for the GenAI chat application.  
- **Azure OpenAI Integration**: Incorporates OpenAI models for generating high-quality responses and insights.  
- **LangChain Integration**: Utilizes LangChain with Azure OpenAI to streamline and optimize AI-driven interactions.  
- **Prompty Integration**: Enhances prompt engineering for dynamic and adaptive AI behavior, improving user query handling.  
- **Semantic Kernel Integration**: Employs Semantic Kernel to orchestrate workflows, ensuring efficient, context-aware AI responses.  
- **.NET Backend**: Handles API orchestration and server-side processing, seamlessly integrating Azure services.  
- **Event-Driven Document Processing**: Uses Azure Functions to create vector embeddings in Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB VCore, triggered by document uploads.  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Deploys resources using Bicep and Azure CLI to ensure consistent, scalable, and secure infrastructure management.

## Usage

Follow these steps to set up and deploy the solution:

### 1. Clone the Repository from GitHub:  
Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonathanscholtes/Azure-AI-RAG-CSharp-Prompty.git
cd Azure-AI-RAG-CSharp-Prompty
```

### 2. Deploy the Solution Using Bicep:  
Navigate to the deployment directory:

```bash
cd infra
```

Then, use the following PowerShell command to deploy the solution. Make sure to replace the placeholders with your actual subscription name, Azure Region (location)

**PowerShell**
```bash
.\deploy.ps1 -Subscription '[Subscription Name]' -Location 'southcentralus'
```

This script will provision the necessary resources in your Azure subscription according to the specified parameters. The deployment may take upto **30 minutes** to provision all Azure resources.


### 3. Upload Documents for Azure AI Search Indexing:

Upload the HTML files from the [documents](documents) directory to the **load** container of the Azure Storage Account.

![storage network](./media/storage_container_load.png)

### 4. Validate Embedding Load in Azure AI Search
The Loader Azure Function will trigger and upload the index as the documents are added to the Azure Storage Account. We can view the index and number of documents in the index from our Azure AI Search Service.

##### Grant Access to Query Index From Portal
If you received an error attempting to query the index from the portal you will need to set the API Access control to **both**.
![api_access_control](./media/azure_ai_search_api_access_control.png)


##### Validate Index Creation
You can quickly verify that you have the index **azure-support** with the indexed documents by viewing *indexes*. 

![indexes](./media/azure_ai_search_indexes.png)




### 6. Validate GenAI Application

Access the Azure Web App hosting the API (/swagger) by navigating to its assigned domain. Once the application loads, test its functionality by submitting the default question, "unable to connect to blob storage" for customer 5.

Upon submission, you should see the following results displayed:

## Clean-Up

After completing testing, ensure to delete any unused Azure resources or remove the entire Resource Group to avoid incurring additional charges.

### Resource Purge for Redeployment

If you plan to delete and redeploy this solution, you may need to manually purge **Azure OpenAI**.

#### Azure OpenAI Purge

To permanently delete an Azure OpenAI or other Azure AI service, follow [these steps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/recover-purge-resources?tabs=azure-portal#purge-a-deleted-resource):

1. **Navigate to the Azure AI Service Hub**:  
   Go to the hub of the Azure AI service associated with the deleted resource. For instance, if you need to purge an "Anomaly Detector" resource, search for "Anomaly Detector" in the Azure portal search bar, select the service, and then choose **Manage Deleted Resources** from the menu.

2. **Select the Subscription and Deleted Resource**:  
   In the **Manage Deleted Resources** section, choose the relevant subscription from the dropdown list, then locate and select the deleted resource(s) you wish to purge.

3. **Purge the Resource**:  
   Click **Purge** to permanently delete the selected resource(s). Be aware that purging is irreversible and removes all associated configurations and data for the resource.
