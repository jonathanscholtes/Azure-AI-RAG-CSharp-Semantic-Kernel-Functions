<h1>Azure Virtual Network Gateway VPN Connection Failure</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Azure Virtual Network Gateway VPN connection failures often occur due to configuration mismatches, certificate issues, or incorrect pre-shared keys. These failures can prevent successful establishment of a VPN connection between an on-premises network and an Azure virtual network. To resolve this issue, it is crucial to ensure alignment between the on-premises and Azure configurations.</p>
<p>Configuration mismatches can arise from differences in settings such as IP address ranges, subnet masks, or encryption protocols. Certificate issues may occur if the certificates used for authentication are expired, revoked, or not properly installed. Incorrect pre-shared keys can also lead to connection failures if the keys do not match on both ends of the VPN tunnel.</p>

<h2>Possible Error Messages:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Error 789: The L2TP connection attempt failed because the security layer encountered a processing error during initial negotiations with the remote computer.</li>
  <li>Error 798: A certificate could not be found that can be used with this Extensible Authentication Protocol.</li>
  <li>Error 720: A connection to the remote computer could not be established. You might need to change the network settings for this connection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resolution Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Verify the on-premises and Azure configurations to ensure they match. Check IP address ranges, subnet masks, and encryption protocols to identify any discrepancies. Make necessary adjustments to align the configurations.</li>
  <li>Check the certificates used for authentication. Ensure that they are not expired, revoked, or improperly installed. If necessary, renew or reinstall the certificates.</li>
  <li>Double-check the pre-shared keys used for authentication. Ensure that they match on both ends of the VPN tunnel. If the keys do not match, update them accordingly.</li>
  <li>Restart the VPN gateway and the on-premises VPN device. Sometimes, a simple restart can resolve connectivity issues.</li>
  <li>If the issue persists, review the VPN logs for more detailed error information. The logs can provide insights into the specific cause of the connection failure.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Next Steps:</h2>
<p>If the above resolution steps do not resolve the issue, consider reaching out to Azure support for further assistance. They can provide guidance and troubleshooting specific to your environment.</p>
