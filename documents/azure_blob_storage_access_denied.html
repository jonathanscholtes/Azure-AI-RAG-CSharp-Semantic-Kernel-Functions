<h1>Azure Blob Storage Access Denied</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Accessing Azure Blob Storage may fail due to incorrect permissions, invalid SAS tokens, or missing authentication credentials. This issue can occur when the user or application attempting to access the storage does not have the appropriate access rights. It is crucial to ensure that the necessary permissions and authentication credentials are correctly configured to resolve this problem.</p>

<h2>Possible Error Messages:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Error: Access Denied</li>
  <li>Error: Invalid SAS token</li>
  <li>Error: Missing authentication credentials</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resolution Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Verify the permissions: Check if the user or application has the necessary permissions to access the Azure Blob Storage. Ensure that the appropriate roles and access policies are assigned to the user or application.</li>
  <li>Review SAS token: If you are using a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token for authentication, double-check that the token is valid and has not expired. Generate a new SAS token if needed.</li>
  <li>Check authentication credentials: If you are using authentication credentials (such as account name and account key), ensure that they are correctly provided and match the storage account details. Verify that the credentials have not been changed or revoked.</li>
  <li>Inspect network settings: Confirm that there are no network connectivity issues preventing access to the Azure Blob Storage. Check firewall settings, network security groups, and any other network configurations that may be blocking the access.</li>
  <li>Review storage account configuration: Examine the storage account settings and ensure that the appropriate access control settings are in place. Check if any recent changes to the storage account configuration have caused the access issue.</li>
