<h1>Azure Monitor Alert Not Triggering</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>Azure Monitor alerts may not trigger due to incorrect alert rule configurations, metric thresholds, or missing telemetry data. It is essential to ensure that the alert settings are properly configured and that the necessary data is being ingested into Azure Monitor.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting involves reviewing the alert rule settings and verifying that the metric thresholds are set correctly. Additionally, it is important to check if the required telemetry data is being sent to Azure Monitor for the specific resource or service being monitored.</p>
