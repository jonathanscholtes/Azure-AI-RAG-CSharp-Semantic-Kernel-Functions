    <h1>Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Deployment Issues</h1>

    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Deployments to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) may fail due to misconfigured YAML files, insufficient resources, or connectivity issues with the Azure container registry. 
        Properly configuring and debugging the deployment pipeline is essential to resolving these problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Misconfigured YAML files can lead to deployment failures and unexpected behavior. It is recommended to review YAML files thoroughly for syntax, indentation, 
        and resource definition issues. Missing or incorrect values in the YAML files may also cause deployment problems.
    </p>
    <p>
        Insufficient resources can also result in failures. Ensure the cluster has enough resources to handle the deployment by verifying the resource limits and requests 
        specified in the YAML files against the available resources in the AKS cluster.
    </p>
    <p>
        Connectivity issues with the Azure container registry may prevent successful deployments. Verify that the AKS cluster has the necessary permissions and authentication 
        credentials, and check the network connectivity between the cluster and the registry.
    </p>

    <h2>Possible Error Messages:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Error: Invalid YAML file format</li>
        <li>Insufficient resources for deployment</li>
        <li>Failed to authenticate with Azure container registry</li>
        <li>Connection timeout to Azure container registry</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Resolution Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Review the YAML files: Examine them for syntax errors, indentation issues, or missing/incorrect values. Use a YAML linter or validator to ensure proper formatting.</li>
        <li>Check resource allocation: Verify the resource limits and requests in the YAML files against the available cluster resources. Adjust as needed or scale up the cluster.</li>
        <li>Validate authentication credentials: Confirm that the credentials for accessing the Azure container registry are correctly configured and have the necessary permissions.</li>
        <li>Test network connectivity: Ensure there are no firewall rules or network configurations blocking connectivity between the AKS cluster and the Azure container registry.</li>
        <li>Monitor deployment logs: Check deployment logs for error messages or warnings that provide insights into the problem and troubleshoot accordingly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Next Steps:</h2>
