<h1>Azure Virtual Machine Won't Start</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>An Azure Virtual Machine (VM) may fail to start due to resource allocation issues, incorrect configurations, or service disruptions. Resolving this issue requires investigating both Azure resource settings and the VM's operating system state.</p>
<p>Resource allocation issues can occur when the VM does not have enough available resources, such as CPU, memory, or storage, to start. Incorrect configurations, such as misconfigured network settings or incompatible VM extensions, can also prevent the VM from starting. Additionally, service disruptions, such as Azure platform outages or maintenance activities, can impact the VM's ability to start.</p>

<h2>Possible Error Messages:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>"Virtual machine failed to start."</li>
  <li>"Insufficient resources to start the virtual machine."</li>
  <li>"Failed to allocate resources for the virtual machine."</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resolution Steps:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Check the Azure portal for any resource allocation issues. Ensure that the VM has enough available resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to start. If necessary, consider resizing the VM or adjusting the resource allocation settings.</li>
  <li>Review the VM's configuration settings, including network settings and VM extensions. Verify that all settings are correct and compatible with the VM's operating system. Make any necessary adjustments or corrections.</li>
  <li>Check the Azure Service Health dashboard for any ongoing service disruptions or maintenance activities that may be impacting the VM's ability to start. If there are any known issues, wait for the service to be restored or follow the recommended actions provided by Azure support.</li>
  <li>If the VM's operating system is not starting properly, try accessing the VM through the Azure portal's serial console or remote desktop connection. Troubleshoot any operating system errors or issues that may be preventing the VM from starting.</li>
  <li>If all else fails, consider creating a new VM using the same or updated configurations. This can help identify if the issue is specific to the VM or related to the Azure resource settings.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Next Steps:</h2>
<p>If the above resolution steps do not resolve the issue, it is recommended to contact Azure support for further assistance. Provide them with the reference code "AZVM4" and the product ID "126" to help expedite the troubleshooting process.</p>
